        <h1>About the person</h1><br>
        <p>The increased passion I have gained throughout my early software engineering journey has only accumulated positively to the enhancement of my "creative" problem-solving skills.
            The key skills and attributes ( technical and soft business skills) that I have been trained in, I believe it may only bring valuable input to any business looking to upskill an ever-learning student of software engineering.
            As stated above, these are absorbed from various educational experiences that have been important to my journey of consistent
            and persistent development. There are many but 2 that come to mind are:
            <br><br>1. Peer-to-peer learning, enhanced my confidence in communicating my problems with my peers and improving my logical understanding
            of the problem at hand leading to us solving "errors" much more efficiently.
            <br><br>2. A "Growth Mindset", is vital in my day-to-day application of error handling and understanding when my body needs a
            rest because "burnout" leads to unwanted stresses and mental fatigue. Solving this through exercise and taking sufficient breaks from my
            day-to-day schedule.<br><br>This has brought out an undoubted level of consistency which in-hand has led to increased persistence
            in my journey.
            Leading to eye-opening experiences. Beginning as an enthusiastic (SELF-TAUGHT) back-end developer mainly learning the fundamentals
            of Python and SQL. Entering the Wethinkcode boot camp it is learned the values of peer-to-peer learning and error handling through Unit testing. Then being accepted to the ALX software engineering program, learning C programming in terms of bit manipulation
            and various aspects of managing databases with SQL/NoSQL.
            <br><br>My long-term view is to specialize in the fields of data analytics/science, I began by acquiring
            knowledge from verified e-learning platforms on the side while attending school from organizations like 365datascience.
            I'm also focused on using that knowledge to work on personal projects that I believe in and feel can bring creative and business solutions via data extraction and visualization whilst developing that story-telling skill as well.
            These will be based on the fundamentals and business understanding I have attained in various entities ranging from football to Retail.</p>
